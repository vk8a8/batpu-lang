# BatPu Language
This is a C-like language written in Bison and Lex, designed specially for MattBatWings' "BatPU" Minecraft CPU.

This is still in WIP,as it currently does not support:
* Function declarations
* Function calls
* Automatically placed variables

# How to use:
## On linux:

First, CD into the project directory using the terminal.
Next, run `make` to compile the project.
To run the program, type `./mbvl [input file] > [output file]`

## On Windows:

Compile the program manually OR download one of the binaries from the "Releases" tab on the right.
Run the program with `./mbvl.exe [input file] > [output file]`

### Warning: I've only tested the EXE with wine. If it doesn't work, please file an issue.

# Example program:
```
$2 = 42;
$1 = 1;

loop:
if ($1 != $2) {
    $1 = $1 + 1;
    goto loop;
}
%hlt
```
This compiles to:
```
ldi r1 42
ldi r2 2
str r2 r1
ldi r1 1
ldi r2 1
str r2 r1
.loop

ldi r1 1
lod r1 r1
ldi r2 2
lod r2 r2
cmp r1 r2
brh eq .l0

ldi r1 1
lod r1 r1
ldi r2 1
add r1 r2 r1

ldi r2 1
str r2 r1
jmp .loop

.l0 ; IF 
hlt ; inline 
```
