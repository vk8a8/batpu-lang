# MattBat-Vk8a8 Language
This is a c-like language writin in Bison and Lex, designed specially for MattBatWings' "BatPU" Minecraft CPU.

This is still in WIP,as it currently does not support:
* Function declarations
* Function calls
* Automatically placed variables

# How to use:
## On linux:

First, CD into the project directory using the terminal.
Next, run `make` to compile the project.
To run the program, type `./mbvl [input file] > [output file]`

## On Windows:

Compile the program manually OR download one of the binaries from the "Releases" tab on the right.
Run the program with `./mbvl.exe [input file] > [output file]`

### Warning: I've only tested the EXE with wine. If it doesn't work, please file an issue.
